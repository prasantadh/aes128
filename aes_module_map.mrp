    Number used as logic:                    3,822 out of   2,400  159% (OVERMAPPED)
      Number using O6 output only:           3,593
      Number using O5 output only:               0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of   1,200    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        5,580
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         3,405 out of   5,580   61%
    Number with an unused LUT:               1,758 out of   5,580   31%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         417 out of   5,580    7%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:           2,705 out of   4,800   56%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   3
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Pack:2714 - This design has 401 unique register control sets.
   At least 610 SLICE sites are required to implement the 401 unique register control sets.
   The target device has only 600 SLICE sites.
   Please modify the logical design source to reduce the number of unique register control sets.
   As an alternative, please select a device with more SLICE sites.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
